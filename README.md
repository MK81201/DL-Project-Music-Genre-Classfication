# DL-Project-Music-Genre-Classfication


Music is like a mirror, and it tells people a lot about who you are and what you care about, whether you like it or not. We love to say “you are what you stream,”.Companies nowadays use music classification, either to be able to place recommendations to their customers (such as Spotify, Soundcloud) or simply as a product (for example Shazam). Determining music genres is the first step in that direction. Machine Learning techniques have proved to be quite successful in extracting trends and patterns from the large pool of data. The same principles are applied in Music Analysis also.This project is aimed at using the KNN classification algorithm to detect the genre of music from an audio file. The ability to classify an audio file and categorise them according to their genres, has proven to put a huge impact on services mentioned above. This way, they engage their customers more by predicting what type of music a particular customer is interested in and further applying state of the art deep learning methods to give recommendations.


Project Flow
Download/Create the dataset.
Process the audio files and load the data into Numpy Arrays.
Train and Test split on complete dataset
Build the classifier : Defining Functions and calling them as needed
Finding accuracy on Test Data 
Build a Web application using flask for the same.
